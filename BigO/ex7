Which of the following are equivalent to O(N)? Why?
- O(N + P), where P < N/2
- O(2N)
- O(N + logN)
- O(N + M)

A:
+ Yes. if P < N/2. We know that N is the dominant term so we can drop the O(P)
+ Yes. We can drop the constant term so O(2N) = O(N)
+ Yes. O(N) dominates the O(log N) so we can drop O(log N)
+ No. There is no relation between both N & M so we have to keep both term O(N + M)
