An algorithm took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array.
Q: What would the runtime be?

example : 
input: Arr = ['Hello', 'Hi', 'World']

sorted strings = ['ehllo', 'hi', 'dlorw']

sorted Orignal Arr = ['dlorw', 'ehllo', 'hi']

A: 
- Sorting each string is O(s log s) where s = length of the longest string. 
- Do for every sting and there are a string, where a = lenght of the array.
- So we have O(a * s log s)
- To sort all the strings. There are a string. Each string comparison takes O(s) time. There are O(a log a) comparisons => O(a* s log a) time.
- Add everything the runtime will be O(a * s (log a + log s)).
